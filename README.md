# Notes app

## Description

This web application was developed within the framework of the testing workshop of Hola Mundo Day 2024. Its main objective is to serve as a tool for practicing testing techniques, as well as to show good practices in its implementation.

## Features

- View notes: The application allows you to view a list of all stored notes.
- Create notes: New notes can be created by entering a title and a text body.
- Edit notes: Existing notes can be edited by modifying their title and/or text body.
